# Lab07_Collections

## Description
This project allows a user to create and interact with a deck of cards.  
The user can:  
1. Add a new card  
2. Delete a card at an index  
3. Shuffle the deck  

A Deck of cards can have the following numbers:  
 * Ace (1) (14)**  
 * Two (2)  
 * Three (3)  
 * Four (4)  
 * Five (5)  
 * Six (6)  
 * Seven (7)  
 * Eight (8)  
 * Nine (9)  
 * Ten (10)  
 * Jack (11)  
 * Queen (12)  
 * King (13)  
** Ace can be considered both the largest value (14) and the smallest value (1). In this project, it is considered 1.**

A Deck of cards can also have these suites:  
 * Hearts  
 * Diamonds  
 * Clubs  
 * Spades
